There are two versions of the image: base and `-oracle` version.  
Difference between them is that `-oracle` version includes [cx_Oracle](https://pypi.org/project/cx-Oracle/) 
and [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html) libraries.  
If you need to use Oracle database, you should use `-oracle` version.
